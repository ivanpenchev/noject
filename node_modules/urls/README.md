Enhancing urls for express.js.

## URLS.JS

With this module you can name used urls and call them by name in the template.

## Install

```js
urls = require('urls');
```

## Set urls:

Set urls like you set them without this module

```js
urls([ 
  { pattern: "/", view: routes.index, name: "index" },
  { pattern: "/user", view: user.list, name: "user" }
  ], app);
```

*You have to pass the 'app' object so urls.js can move the urls and create dinamic helper.


## Use in templates 

Use url names in templates (jade example)

```js
 p url from urls.js module #{ url("index") }
```
